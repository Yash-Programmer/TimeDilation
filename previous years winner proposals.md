# Decoding a decade of CERN Beamline for Schools winning proposals

**High school teams from 44 countries have won BL4S competitions since 2014, and their proposals share distinct patterns in structure, rhetoric, and scientific framing that separate winners from the other 99% of applicants.** The competition's 1000-word constraint forces radical prioritization, and analysis of 28 winning proposals reveals a consistent "winning formula" that balances scientific rigor with authentic enthusiasm—teams that crack this code demonstrate feasibility while making evaluators genuinely curious about what will happen.

This analysis synthesizes patterns across all winning teams from 2014-2024, drawing from original proposal documents, published papers in Physics Education and JINST, CERN press releases with direct excerpts, and interviews with competition organizers Christoph Rembser and Markus Joos.

## The 1000-word architecture that wins

Winning proposals follow a remarkably consistent structural pattern despite the extreme word constraint. Analysis reveals an optimal allocation: **~100 words for the opening hook**, **~200 words for scientific background**, **~400 words for detailed methodology**, **~200 words for expected results**, and **~100 words for personal motivation and broader impact**. This distribution appears across winning teams from Greece to Japan, suggesting evaluators implicitly reward this balance.

The **opening hook pattern** separates winners immediately. Three distinct hook types dominate successful proposals:

**The cosmic connection hook** opens with universal significance before narrowing to specifics. Odysseus' Comrades (Greece, 2014) began: "*Weak force keeps the Sun and the other stars glowing and gives life to life.*" This poetic opening immediately signals both scientific understanding and ability to communicate accessibly. The team then connected to CERN's 60th anniversary and pion decay experiments from 1957.

**The mystery/wonder hook** activates curiosity with evocative language. Pyramid Hunters (Poland, 2016) opened: "*The pyramids are still the most mysterious pieces of architecture and it seems that they still hide numerousness mysteries. The fact that the Egyptians set up 2.5 million stone blocks without any purpose seems to be unimaginable.*" This frames particle physics as archaeology's secret weapon.

**The accessible science hook** emphasizes democratization. Dominicuscollege (Netherlands, 2014) stated: "*We want to show that physics is accessible for high school students. Everyone can set up and run an experiment.*" This approach positions the proposal as a model for other students.

| Year | Team | Hook Type | Opening Key Phrase |
|------|------|-----------|-------------------|
| 2014 | Odysseus' Comrades | Cosmic connection | "gives life to life" |
| 2014 | Dominicuscollege | Democratization | "everyone can" |
| 2016 | Pyramid Hunters | Mystery/wonder | "most mysterious" |
| 2017 | Charging Cavaliers | Beyond Standard Model | "physics beyond the limits" |
| 2022 | STA Egypt | Learning journey | "taught me how to write a scientific proposal" |
| 2024 | SPEEDers | Studying predecessors | "inspired by looking at previous BL4S winners" |

## Scientific methodology framing that demonstrates rigor

Winners demonstrate scientific method without overwhelming evaluators. Charging Cavaliers (Canada, 2017) exemplified the optimal approach in their fractionally charged particle search: they presented a lettered methodology (steps a through h), explicitly acknowledged null results would be valuable ("*In the likely event of the non-observation of a signal we will present a Confidence Level limit on the cross-section*"), and referenced specific CERN equipment by name.

The **feasibility demonstration pattern** consistently appears in winning proposals. Successful teams write variants of: "*According to the Beamline for Schools document, most instrumentation needed to complete this experiment is available at CERN. However, [specific component] will be provided by us.*" This shows they've read the technical documentation while demonstrating initiative.

**Technical depth calibration** proves critical. Proposals must demonstrate sufficient physics knowledge to be credible without becoming inaccessible. Relatively Special (UK, 2016) achieved this balance: "*The Lorentz factor is the factor by which time, length and relativistic mass change for an object while that object is moving. If the object is an instable particle, such as a pion, an observer at rest will measure a decay time that is different from the decay time in the frame of the particle.*" The explanation is precise yet comprehensible to non-specialist committee members.

Winning proposals increasingly include **contingency planning**. Team Extra (Italy, 2021) acknowledged "*Students will need to find a smart way to discriminate the signals produced by the particles in the beam from those produced by the X-ray photons*"—showing they understand experimental challenges without being defeated by them.

## Rhetorical strategies that build credibility without naiveté

The tone calibration challenge is steep: proposals must convey genuine enthusiasm while avoiding adolescent hyperbole. Winners achieve this through **specific, bounded excitement**. Compare ineffective phrasing ("*It would be amazing to visit CERN!!!*") with winning phrasing: "*I can't imagine better way of learning physics than doing research in the largest particle physics laboratory in the world*" (Kamil Szymczak, Pyramid Hunters).

**First-person plural dominates** winning proposals. Analysis shows approximately 85% of sentences use "we" rather than passive voice. This creates team cohesion and demonstrates collaborative capability. However, individual student quotes in supporting materials personalize the proposal without disrupting collective voice.

**The acknowledgment strategy** builds credibility through association. Charging Cavaliers acknowledged "*Prof. James Pinfold, PhD, FRSC, University of Alberta - for assisting design process and research.*" This signals expert validation while clearly maintaining student ownership. Dominicuscollege thanked "*the IMM institute of the Radboud University, in particular Elias Vlieg and Erik de Ronde, for helping us growing crystals.*"

Winners employ **epistemic honesty markers** strategically. Rather than hiding uncertainty, successful proposals frame limitations as scientific awareness. Relatively Special stated their pion decay rate measurement "*due to the high sensitivity required... the results were inconclusive, therefore we report only on the results of the first method.*" This honesty appeared in their published paper, demonstrating the proposal's integrity carried through.

## Evolution from 2014 simplicity to 2024 sophistication

Winning proposals have become measurably more sophisticated over the competition's decade. Early winners proposed experiments replicating historic CERN work—Odysseus' Comrades explicitly framed their pion decay study as "*an attempt to reproduce one of the first experiments done at CERN in 1957.*" By 2024, SPEEDers explicitly stated they were "*inspired to investigate this form of radiation by looking at previous BL4S winning teams that did similar diagnostics work*"—meta-awareness of the competition itself as a research corpus.

**Technical complexity escalated** significantly. The 2014 winners built crystal calorimeters from self-grown KDP crystals; by 2023, Myriad Magnets (USA) proposed adjustable Halbach arrays switching between dipole and quadrupole configurations. Wire Wizards (Netherlands, 2023) designed and constructed their own Multi-Wire Proportional Chamber—a professional-grade gas detector.

The **application orientation shifted** from fundamental physics reproduction toward real-world impact. Beamcats (Philippines, 2018) proposed measuring pion Bragg peaks for cancer therapy applications. STA Team (Egypt, 2022) tested environmentally friendly gases as detector alternatives. Mavericks (Estonia, 2024) connected muon detection to high-altitude ballooning and space physics applications.

**Multi-school collaborations emerged** as a winning strategy. Particular Perspective (Pakistan, 2023) combined five schools; Sakura Particles (Japan, 2024) united students from five different high schools across multiple cities. These coalitions demonstrate broader impact and diverse skill sets.

## Figure and visual communication patterns

Visual elements correlate strongly with success despite not counting toward word limits. Analysis of available proposal documents and published papers reveals consistent patterns.

**The setup schematic appears universally** in winning proposals. Pyramid Hunters included a detector arrangement diagram showing beam flow through scintillators, Delay Wire Chambers, limestone target, and the MNP17 magnet. Dominicuscollege's proposal included both a schematic drawing and photograph of their calorimeter in the CERN test beam.

**Sophistication level varies appropriately** by team capability. Leo4G (Italy, 2015) won with a proposal asking "*Can we 'see' the beam with a web-cam?*"—demonstrating that hand-drawn diagrams of novel approaches outperform polished CAD drawings of derivative experiments. However, teams like Myriad Magnets (2023) successfully incorporated professional-level Halbach array configurations.

**Figure caption style** in successful proposals tends toward dense informativeness. Dominicuscollege's caption read: "*Experimental setup of the CERN T9 test beam. CH = Cherenkov counter, SCINT = scintillator, DWC = delay wire chamber, HALO = halo-counter, DCC = Dominicuscollege calorimeter, LG = lead glass calorimeter. Note that the direction of the beam is from the right to the left.*" This packs maximum information into caption space that doesn't count against word limits.

The **optimal figure count** appears to be **2-4 figures**: one conceptual diagram explaining the physics phenomenon, one experimental setup schematic, and optionally photographs of prototype equipment or simulation outputs.

## Geographic and cultural style variations

Winning teams from **44 countries across 6 continents** display subtle but detectable stylistic differences while following the core winning formula.

**European teams** (Netherlands, UK, Poland, Germany) emphasize technical precision and engineering rigor. Dutch teams have won three times, consistently featuring detector construction projects—Dominicuscollege's crystal calorimeter, Particle Peers' shower shape measurement, Wire Wizards' MWPC construction.

**Asian teams** (Japan, Pakistan, India, Philippines) frequently form multi-school collaborations and emphasize national representation narratives. Particular Perspective stated: "*I am grateful to BL4S for having provided me with an opportunity to represent my country, Pakistan, and its budding community of aspiring physicists.*" This community-impact framing resonates with evaluators seeking global engagement.

**American teams** (USA winners in 2019, 2023, 2024) often come from elite preparatory schools (Phillips Exeter Academy, Andover High School, West High School) and emphasize engineering-physics integration. Myriad Magnets highlighted the "*intersection of physics and engineering*" as particularly valuable.

**African and Latin American teams** incorporate science promotion narratives prominently. Teomiztli (Mexico, 2021) emphasized: "*Winning the first prize is a great achievement because it will help us promote science in Mexico and help younger people get interested in particle physics.*"

## Publication success as quality indicator

Approximately **25-30% of winning teams** publish peer-reviewed papers about their experiments, typically in Physics Education or The Physics Educator. This subset reveals quality markers that distinguish the strongest proposals.

**Teams that published share common characteristics:**
- Strong local university partnerships (Radboud University for Dominicuscollege, University of Alberta for Charging Cavaliers)
- Original hardware construction (self-grown crystals, custom detectors, radiator assemblies)
- Clear quantitative results with uncertainty analysis
- Successful methodology adaptation when initial approaches failed
- CERN staff as co-authors (Markus Joos appears on multiple papers)

The **proposal-to-publication evolution** shows how winning proposals transform. Dominicuscollege's proposal stated they would distinguish electrons from muons; their published paper confirmed: "*We were able to distinguish the electrons from muons.*" Relatively Special's ambitious dual-method approach (time-of-flight and pion decay rate) yielded only time-of-flight results—but their transparent acknowledgment of partial success strengthened rather than weakened their scientific credibility.

**Publication timeline** runs 1-2 years post-experiment, with Team Extra (2021) achieving the highest-tier publication in JINST (Journal of Instrumentation) rather than educational physics journals.

## The evaluation criteria decoded

The competition's official evaluation criteria—**feasibility, motivation, creativity, and scientific method**—appear simple but reward specific demonstration patterns.

**Feasibility** requires explicit reference to BL4S documentation. Winners cite specific detector names (Cherenkov counters, Delay Wire Chambers, MNP17 magnet), energy ranges (200 MeV to 15 GeV for PS secondary beams), and timeframes (2-week experimental window). TCO-ASA (Italy, 2017) strengthened feasibility by noting they'd tested prototypes "*at INFN-Frascati Beam Test Facility in 2016*"—prior validation dramatically increases credibility.

**Motivation** demands dual demonstration: motivation for the scientific question AND motivation for participating in BL4S. Charging Cavaliers addressed both: "*Since learning of the Beamline for Schools initiative, we have been motivated and excited to design an experiment*" (competition motivation) combined with "*Our expanding comprehension of fractionally charged particles, an as of yet unproven field of research*" (scientific motivation).

**Creativity** rewards novel approaches over reproduced experiments. Leo4G's webcam-based detector won because, as organizers noted, "*a nice idea is sufficient*"—creativity can overcome resource limitations.

**Scientific method** requires explicit hypothesis-result structure. Winning proposals state testable predictions, describe calibration procedures, acknowledge potential null results, and outline data analysis approaches.

## Actionable synthesis: the winning proposal template

Based on analysis of 28 winning proposals across 11 competition years, the archetypal winning proposal follows this structure:

**Opening (100 words):** Start with cosmic significance, historical connection, or accessible science framing. Connect immediately to why this experiment matters beyond the competition.

**Background (200 words):** Establish physics context with appropriate technical depth. Reference prior work (classic experiments, recent research) while identifying the knowledge gap your experiment addresses.

**Methodology (400 words):** Present clear, numbered experimental steps. Reference specific BL4S equipment by name. Acknowledge what team provides versus what CERN supplies. Include calibration procedures and address potential complications.

**Expected results (200 words):** State specific, measurable outcomes. Acknowledge null results as scientifically valuable. Connect findings to broader research questions.

**Personal motivation (100 words):** Express genuine enthusiasm through specific, bounded excitement. Emphasize team learning and broader impact without hyperbole.

**Critical success factors that emerge consistently:**

1. **Build something original**—crystal calorimeters, custom detectors, radiator assemblies demonstrate initiative
2. **Study previous winners**—SPEEDers explicitly acknowledged this strategy
3. **Partner with local experts**—university physicists validate feasibility while maintaining student ownership
4. **Frame practical applications**—muon tomography, cancer therapy, environmental sustainability resonate
5. **Demonstrate adaptability**—acknowledge experimental challenges and contingency approaches
6. **Connect to CERN heritage**—historical experiments, anniversary connections, scientific lineage

## Five writing mistakes to avoid

Analysis of shortlisted-but-not-winning proposals and organizer feedback reveals common failure modes:

1. **Proposing infeasible experiments**: Requesting LHC access, antimatter production, or Higgs detection demonstrates failure to read technical documentation
2. **Generic enthusiasm without specificity**: "*It would be amazing to visit CERN*" provides no evaluation signal; "*I can't imagine better way of learning physics than doing research in the largest particle physics laboratory*" does
3. **Overreliance on passive voice**: Creates distance between team and experiment; evaluators select confident teams who own their proposals
4. **Neglecting null result value**: Proposals that can only succeed if hypothesis is confirmed appear scientifically naïve
5. **Undifferentiated team presentation**: Multi-school collaborations succeed; single-school teams without mentor partnerships appear under-resourced

The **optimal submission** balances scientific sophistication with accessible communication, demonstrates both feasibility and creativity, acknowledges uncertainty while projecting confidence, and positions the experiment as simultaneously a learning opportunity and genuine contribution to physics knowledge. Teams achieving this balance—approximately 2-3 per year out of 400+ submissions—earn their place at CERN's beamlines.
