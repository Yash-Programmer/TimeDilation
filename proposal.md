# CERN Beamline for Schools: Complete proposal formatting guide

**The written proposal—not the video—determines winners.** CERN's BL4S competition evaluates proposals on feasibility, scientific method, motivation, and creativity, with a strict **1,000-word limit** submitted through an online portal. Shortlisted teams invest **50+ hours** (versus 30 hours average), and successful proposals balance genuine enthusiasm with clear scientific methodology. The video and outreach components are optional but offer separate prizes and recognition.

---

## The online submission eliminates format specifications

Unlike traditional academic submissions, BL4S proposals are entered through **CERN's online web form** rather than uploaded as documents. This means there are no page limits, font requirements, or margin specifications—the system captures text directly.

**What counts toward the 1,000-word limit:**
- Main proposal text describing motivation, experiment, and outcomes

**What does NOT count toward the limit:**
- Equations and formulas
- References and acknowledgements  
- Text within diagrams (within reason)

Teams wanting to include additional technical detail should **host supplementary materials on an external website** that reviewers can consult if needed. CERN explicitly suggests this approach for proposals requiring more depth than the word limit allows.

The only absolute format requirement is that **all submissions must be in English**—proposals in other languages are automatically rejected.

## Required sections follow a precise word allocation

CERN specifies three mandatory sections with approximate word distributions:

**Motivation (~100 words):** Explain why your team wants to participate in BL4S and why you chose your specific experiment topic. Winning teams connect this to current scientific developments—the "Relatively Special" team (2016 UK winners) referenced the 100th anniversary of general relativity and the recent LIGO discovery.

**Experiment description (~800 words):** Detail your experiment idea and how you would use the particle beamline. This section should include your hypothesis, methodology, and expected approach. The 2016 winners structured this with clear subsections: Aim, Theory, Method 1, Method 2, Summary, Experimental Setup, and Step-by-step Method.

**Expected outcomes (~100 words):** Describe what you hope to learn and how you'll share the experience. Winners consistently emphasize outreach commitments—promising to "promote physics in our school to raise interest amongst fellow students."

An **optional outreach section** adds 200 words, bringing the maximum to 1,200 words. This describes a science education activity you've organized or plan to organize, with inclusiveness as a key component.

## Winning proposals reveal a consistent structure

Analysis of the "Relatively Special" proposal (2016 UK winners, later published in Physics Education) shows how successful teams organize their submissions:

**Section flow:** The winning structure moves from accessible motivation → technical theory with equations → detailed methodology → impact statement → acknowledgements. This creates a narrative arc that judges can follow from "why this matters" to "exactly how we'll do it."

**Technical depth achieved within limits:** The proposal included 8-10 equations (Lorentz factor, time dilation, relativistic momentum, exponential decay) with step-by-step derivations explaining each variable. Critically, equations don't count toward the word limit, allowing teams to demonstrate physics knowledge without sacrificing explanation space.

**Visual elements:** Winners include at least one graph or diagram. "Relatively Special" included a theoretical prediction graph showing "Expected proportion of pions remaining after 12m" versus "Momentum/GeV/c" with clear axis labels and units.

**Specific technical references:** Successful proposals reference CERN's actual equipment by name—MNP17 magnet, Cherenkov counters, scintillators, delay wire chambers—demonstrating teams have studied the Beam & Detectors technical document.

**Effective title examples from winners:**
- "Testing the validity of the Lorentz factor" (Relatively Special, UK)
- "Search for fractionally charged particles" (Charging Cavaliers, Canada)
- "Muon absorption in limestone" (Pyramid Hunters, Poland—pyramid tomography)
- "Webcam as particle detector" (Leo4G, Italy)

## Visual presentation guidelines

**Diagrams and figures are explicitly encouraged** and text within them doesn't count toward the word limit. However, CERN provides no specific resolution, size, or color requirements since submission is through a web form.

**What winning visual elements include:**
- Experimental setup diagrams showing detector placement relative to beam path
- Theoretical prediction graphs with clearly labeled axes and units
- Distances between components and specific detector purposes noted
- Clean, readable labels and captions

**Equation formatting:** Since submissions go through a web form, complex LaTeX-style equations may need to be included as images or simplified notation. The key is clarity—derivations should show work, not just final forms.

**Logo usage:** The BL4S logo can be used in proposals. CERN, DESY, University of Bonn, and ELSA logos are legally protected and forbidden for third-party use.

## Writing style balances accessibility with rigor

The audience is a multi-stage selection committee: first CERN volunteers from member-state universities, then a team of physicists and safety experts, and finally CERN's SPS and PS Experiment Committee (SPSC).

**Winning tone characteristics:**
- Enthusiastic but professional
- Confident without arrogance
- Demonstrates genuine curiosity and authentic passion
- Shows understanding of scientific process
- Acknowledges limitations ("within experimental accuracy")

**Structure within writing:** Opening sentences connect to broader scientific context (current discoveries, anniversaries, real-world applications). Theory sections become technical but explain each step. Methods use numbered steps with specific detector names. Closings return to motivational, outreach-focused language.

**Example of effective motivation writing** (from "Relatively Special"):
> "This turning point helped inspire us to delve deeper into Einstein's theories and their implications in the natural world and made us feel that it is quite appropriate to base an experiment on one of his many great discoveries."

**Critical calibration:** CERN explicitly states they are "not expecting a fully developed experimental proposal with a detailed setup and hypothesis." An idea communicated creatively is enough—refinement happens after selection with CERN scientists.

## The video is optional but valuable

**The video does NOT determine winners.** From 2021 onward, only the written proposal is judged for main competition selection. However, submitting a video enables:

- **Best Video Award** (3 teams annually receive prizes)
- Automatic shortlist inclusion if video wins
- Additional visibility for your team

**Video specifications:**
- Maximum **1 minute** duration
- Upload to **YouTube or Vimeo** and submit the link
- Must be in English
- Should summarize the proposal creatively and **introduce team members**
- Creativity and entertainment value explicitly valued over production quality

**What successful videos include:** Team introductions showing faces and enthusiasm, visual explanation of the experiment, authentic student-made style (valued over polished production), the team's motivation and passion for physics.

---

## The outreach proposal targets separate recognition

The **optional 200-word outreach section** describes a science education activity you've organized or plan to organize. Fifteen teams with the best outreach proposals win telescopes signed by Nobel laureates and the CERN Director-General.

**Required elements:**
- Description of specific activity (completed or planned)
- Inclusiveness as a key component
- Target audiences with limited access to science

Winners are asked to document their activity afterward, with outcomes shared on the BL4S website.

## Submission mechanics and timeline

**Process:** Team coaches (adults) submit through CERN's online form at beamline-for-schools.web.cern.ch. The portal opens in January with a March deadline (13 March 2026 at 23:59 CEST for BL4S 2026).

**Pre-registration** is optional but provides access to Q&A sessions, virtual visits to CERN and DESY, and competition updates. It doesn't require a ready proposal.

**No information exists** about whether revisions are allowed after submission. Supplementary materials should be hosted externally rather than attached.

**Copyright warning:** Entries containing third-party content (images, video, music) without written permission face disqualification.

## What separates winners from the field

**Time investment matters dramatically.** CERN's own data shows average teams spend **30 hours** on proposals while shortlisted teams invest **50+ hours**. The official guidance states plainly: "Effort pays out."

**The five evaluation criteria (in order):**
1. Feasibility of the experiment
2. Scientific method (ability to follow it)
3. Motivation of the experiment
4. Motivation to participate in BL4S
5. Creativity of the experiment

**Common winner characteristics:**
- Reference CERN's beam properties (0.5-10 GeV/c momentum, available particle types) and specific detectors
- Propose experiments achievable within the 2-week timeframe
- Build equipment beforehand (Dominicus College grew their own crystals; TCO-ASA built their Cherenkov detector before winning)
- Contact CERN scientists during proposal preparation for feasibility feedback
- Apply after previous "highly commended" attempts

**Critical mistakes to avoid:**
- Exceeding word limits
- Using languages other than English
- Having coaches write the science (students must create the proposal)
- Ignoring the Beam & Detectors technical document
- Proposing experiments incompatible with available equipment or timeframe

## Winner perspectives on proposal preparation

**Isabella Vesely (2023 winner, "Myriad Magnets," now at MIT):** "BL4S supported us to directly explore and apply new skills, particularly in the intersection of physics and engineering."

**Zohaib Abbas (2023 winner, "Particular Perspective," now at Harvard):** After winning, "hundreds of people in Pakistan have been reaching out to me because they didn't know about this opportunity."

**Davide Cartuccia (2017 winner, "TSCO-ASA," Italy):** "Coming up with the ideas and writing a scientific proposal is a lot of work, but it is also an experience we can profit from when we finish school and start looking for jobs."

**James Hirst (2016 winner, UK):** "The competition inspired lower years in my school to compete and to get interested in physics. It has also fascinated the local area, with some primary schools asking us to do talks."

**Sabrina Giorgetti (2015 winner, "Leo4G," now PhD at CMS):** "I can say confidently that the reason I chose physics for my bachelor's, master's and PhD was because of this experience."
